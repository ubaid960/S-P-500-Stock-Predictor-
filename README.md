This is the R markdown file of my capstone team project in BSDS 100. We used deep learning algorithms to analyze trends in the S&P 500 index, and predicted whether the index would rise or fluctuate. We have used concepts learned such as “as.Date” to convert data types into dates to identify future trends in the stock market. as well converting data from factor to numeric to analyze and predict whether the index would rise or fluctuate. S&P 500 is a traded index of the largest 500 companies in the U.S.; experts consider the index to be the best representation of the stock market. The data used in this is collectively from 'Yahoo Data,' as well as from data.hub, so we amalgamated both datasets into a single master data. The macro goal of this project is to get a better understanding of how trends in the market can be foreseen, which will assist people in making smarter investment decisions.
